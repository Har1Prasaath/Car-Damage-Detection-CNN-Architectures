## Overview

The Car Damage Detection System is a deep learning-based image classification pipeline built using TensorFlow and InceptionV3. It automatically detects whether a car is damaged or whole by training on labeled image data, with support for real-time predictions.

## How to Run ???

- All the required packages are listed in the source file itself, so running the code directly should work without any issues.
- To reduce the runtime, it is recommended to run the code using a GPU.
